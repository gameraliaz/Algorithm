Algorithm
=============
In this "solution" the useful and required algorithms are to be implemented in C #, at present only the QuickSelect algorithm is implemented. Which, of course, is a student homework assignment.

Quick Select
---------------
#### how to use ####

1. add Select dll file to your project
2. using Select
3. var answer = Quick.QuickSelect<TypeOfValues>(YourList,YourList.Count,K);
